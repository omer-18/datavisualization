This app is like a visual chart builder. You have a dataset (like car information), and the app shows you all the columns (miles per gallon, car brand, etc.). You drag those columns into slots like "X-axis" or "Y-axis" or "Color," and it automatically builds a chart. It figures out whether your data is numbers, categories, or dates, and picks the right chart type. No coding—just drag, drop, and see your chart appear. It's like a smart version of Excel's chart wizard, but more interactive and visual.
